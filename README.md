## Learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup.

### Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

We instantiate a Beautiful Soup object to parse the HTML structure of news articles, enabling extraction of titles and preview text. Subsequently, we organize the scraped data into Python dictionaries, assigning each dictionary two keys: "title" and "preview". Finally, we aggregate these dictionaries within a Python list for comprehensive storage and manipulation.

### Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
